        <p>Thus begining of our journey.</p>
        <p>We may not have many pics together but we sure do share a lot of memories.</p>
        <p>We did many things some were fun some were not so fun,some broke out into fight,but it never affected our friendship.</p>
        <p>There is one truth that our friendship will come to an end one day</p>
        <p>But we should make more memories before that day comes</p>
        <p>Idk how but u r always cheerful,kind to people.That is what makes your different than others</p>
